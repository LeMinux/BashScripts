These are some bash scripts that I made either for practicality or for fun.

Be carful about the scripts in Destory. As the name suggests they are meant to
destroy a (Linux) system. The permission on these files you will have to manually enable executable permissions,
and you will need to uncommenet the danger AND complete the validity check.
Anything that can alter a system will have the same treatment really.
