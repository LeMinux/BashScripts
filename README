These are some bash scripts that I made either for practicality or for fun.

Be carful about the scripts in Destory. As the name suggests they are meant to
destroy a (Linux) system. The permission on these files are set to 400 (r--------) (user read only),
and you will need to uncommenet the danger AND complete the validity check.
