This is a bash script to help add multiple users and set them to their groups.
If the group does not exist, it will make it.

This script will also check if the user or group(s) have sudo permissions. If
sudo permission is detected it will prompt to confirm if this is correct.

There are two modes

No File Mode:
	FORMAT -> userAndSSH.sh
	If no file is specified then it will prompt for the creation of just a
	single user. This way a file with a single line is not needed.
	The prompts will ask for the user name and groups.

File Mode:
	FORMAT -> ./userAndSSH.sh <file>

	If a file is specified it will parse through it to verify if the syntax is
	correct. The file MUST contain the group delimiter '|' and the secondary
	group delimiter ':' in the order of <user>|<primary group>:<list of secondary groups>

	There must be a user entry, but primary and secondary groups are optional.
	If only the user name is specified it will simply create the user.
	Ex:
	BigGuppy|:

	If multiple secondary groups are desired it must follow as if it was the
	normal adduser command. Separated by commas with no whitespace
	Ex:
	John|:Accounting,FloorOne
	Mary|:Secretary,TopFloor

	If the file is verified to have the correct syntax it will parse through
	and create the accounts. If even one syntax error is detected it will not
	parse through the file. This is done because it is better to know right
	off the bat to know about errors rather than being told in a sea of
	valid and invalid statments. This ensures that all users are made and none
	will be missed.
